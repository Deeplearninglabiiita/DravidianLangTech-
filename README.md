Shared Task on Misogyny Meme Detection - DravidianLangTech@NAACL 2025   
The Shared Task on Misogyny Meme Detection is organized as part of DravidianLangTech@NAACL 2025. This task presents a multimodal machine learning challenge, encouraging participants to design systems capable of analyzing both the textual and visual elements of memes sourced from social media platforms. The objective is to classify these memes as Misogynistic or Non-misogynistic in the Tamil and Malayalam languages.

Participants will initially receive training and development datasets to build and validate their models. A test set will be released at a later stage for the final evaluation. The final evaluation of the submitted systems will be based on their macro F1 score, a widely used performance metric for classification tasks in Natural Language Processing (NLP).

This shared task is expected to attract researchers and professionals from NLP and multimodal learning communities worldwide, fostering innovation and advancing research in misogyny detection across multilingual and multimodal settings.
